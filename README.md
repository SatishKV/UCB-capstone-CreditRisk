#### Credit risk modeling is the process of estimating the probability of whether an individual will pay back a loan (auto, home etc). As a matter of fact, Credit risk modeling goes much beyond personal loan process and these models can be applied to various customer scenarios that involves risk assessment in Banking, Insurance and Investment Management industries. This capstone project focuses on personal loan processing and leverages supervised classifer models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees and SVM to determine the optimal classifer to use for our problem

#### Banks and other financial firms that are offering personal lending products have for eons have tried to leverage various credit risk models to determine the propensity of a customer defaulting on a loan. These credit risk models are critical especially during economic downturn situations like the one we are facing in United States. Many credit risk models used in banking today are based on traditional data architecture which are rules based and operates on structured data. However, with the growing body of data available about a individual online, Banks are exploring machine learning and AI models for analyzing a large scale of data that covers 360 degree view of the customers viz. demographics, employment history, financial health (debt to income ratio), risky financial behaviors etc. Given the dimensions and data elements will increase exponentially, it is important for banks to leverage newer data science models to again insights into customer risk profile.


#### Research Question
I'm interested in exploring financial loan transactions related dataset. I want to explore the possibility of creating models for assessing the credit risk associated with an individual applying for the loan and also want to explore whether banks can be innovative a tailer loan products based on the characteristics of their customer segment.
Credit risk measures how likely a borrower is to pay back a loan - whether it’s a mortgage, a personal loan or a credit card. Lenders consider a potential borrower’s credit risk to inform the decisions they make before extending them a line of credit. And in many cases, lenders use information like the applicant’s credit history and DTI ratio to assess credit risk.
Generally speaking, borrowers with higher credit scores are considered less risky to lenders. They may be viewed as more likely to pay back a loan on time and in full, so they are more likely to receive the loans they apply for. 

#### Data Sources
I'm going to look for the dataset from open data source sites such as Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nezukokamaado/auto-loan-dataset 
#### Methodology
Leverages CRISP-DM data science development methodology. It contains the following 6 phases
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment
